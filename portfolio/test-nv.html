<h2> FLIPVIEW LAYOUT (CUSTOMER - NVISION)</h2>
<br><br><br>

<div style='display: inline-block;width:55%;vertical-align: top; margin-right:30px;text-align: left;'>
This customer project involved showing the data between different categories using a 3d flip. A 3d flip is different from normal swipe in a way that the slide is rotated instead of animating left or right. The video shows a demo of the implementation we open sourced after doing the customer project. (check open source project <a href='https://github.com/agaase/flipview'>here.</a>)

<p>
There were many points that we took care of in terms of how the user will interact with a layout like this.
</p>
<p>
1. The ability to quickly flip to the next slide by doing a swipe using touch. (Check 6-9 sec in video)
</p>
<p>
2. Panning effect in which case the user can drag the slide instead of quickly flipping it such that he can see the back and front slide simulataneously.(Check 19-27 sec in video). 
</p>
<p>
3. An appearance that slide moves inside and as such looks smaller when the flip or dragging is done. This also makes sure that slide when its rotated it doesnt get cut at the device boundaries.
